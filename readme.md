This repository contains metadata for all articles in *al-Hilāl* in TEI (`<biblStruct>`) and MODS serialisation. Information was scraped from <zaidanfoundation.org> and <archive.sharekh.co>. It has not been verified against fascimiles. The data has been integrated into the [OpenArabicPE Zotero Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/904125/openarabicpe/collections/S4H222UZ).



to do: 

- there is limited metadata and facsimiles available at sharekh.archive
- reconcile the two data sources:
    + I have already scraped and converted all metadata to TEI
    + need some XLST to combine the two
